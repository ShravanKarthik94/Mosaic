<p>The chart below describes the relationship between happiness among the sexes based on the marital status. Based on values from the <strong><em>happy</em></strong> dataset, the attribute <em>happy</em>, <em>sex</em> and <em>marital</em> are selected and fed to the <strong>prodplot</strong> function. To establish the relationship between the three attributes, we use a combination of the horizontal and vertical spines as dividers to the plot.</p>
<p>Initially the attribute <em>marital</em> is distributed along the width of the graph using <strong>hspine</strong> as the divider. From this plot, one can conclude a large portion of the people surveyed are married.</p>

<p>Each marital status is further split based on the sex by using a horizontal spine to represent the split. Thus, the rectangle representing the marital status is split into two, representing male and female respectively.</p>

<p>To determine the happiness of the sexes based on marital status we perform vertical split on each bin. Each bin is now filled with a different color which represents how happy the group is. The plot indicates that for all levels of marital status, men are generally less happier than women.</p>
